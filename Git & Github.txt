Git: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 

GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.


In Git, a commit ID, also known as a SHA-1 hash, is a unique identifier for a specific commit in a Git repository. 
It represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time and is used to track the history and versions of files in the repository.

A repository, often referred to as a "repo," is a place where code and related files are stored and organized.
